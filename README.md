# *Immunizing the Economy: A Causality Discussion on Vaccines and Economic Recovery*

Source code for my paper *Immunizing the Economy: A Causality Discussion on Vaccines and Economic Recovery*, submitted for publication to X-Pedientes Económicos Journal from Ecuador's Superintendencia de Compañías, Valores y Seguros (SCVS), a top regulatory and public policy institution. Includes the data used, my .Rproject file and my RMarkdown file (the journal required a .docx document) with the paper's text and code for the regression analyses. Only the wild bootstrap tests were done outside the .Rproject, which will be featured in the preliminary analysis GitHub repository. As of April 2022, a bug seems to have affected the R package *fwildboostrap*, which is why I commented out all bootstrap tests for the paper. You can see the actual results of the test in the [paper's text](https://ojs.supercias.gob.ec/index.php/X-pedientes_Economicos/article/view/103). 

As before, don't hesitate to contact me if you need anything else.
