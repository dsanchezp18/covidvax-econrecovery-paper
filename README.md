# Source Code: *Inoculating the Economy: A causality discussion on vaccines and economic recovery*

Source code for my paper "Inoculating the economy", submitted for publication to X-Pedientes Econ√≥micos Journal. Includes the data used, my .Rproject file and my RMarkdown file (the journal required a .docx document) with the paper's text and code for the regression analyses. Only the wild bootstrap tests were done outside the .Rproject, which will be coming soon to GitHub in another repository.

As before, don't hesitate to contact me if you need anything else. 

Regards,

Daniel
